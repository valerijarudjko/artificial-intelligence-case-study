# Artificial Intelligence Case Study

This project analyses Britair, a fictional British airline that seeks to make punctuality its defining value through the integration of artificial intelligence. It focuses on applying predictive models, computer vision, and reinforcement learning to optimise processes such as boarding, luggage handling, and crew operations. The case also explores the use of AI in customer service through chatbots, personalised offers, and even humanoid robots to enhance the passenger experience. Objectives include reducing delays, improving efficiency, and strengthening customer trust by balancing automation with human oversight. Overall, the project highlights how AI can transform punctuality into a competitive advantage within the airline industry.

## Britair Airlines: Background

A new airline is born in Great Britain with the intention of being competitive in the sector from the start. Due to current fuel prices and crises stemming from a war in Europe, it cannot compete on price. Moreover, it receives support from official bodies, so flight prices are very similar to those of the competition.
Therefore, it must attract users from another point of view. The company's board of directors decides they need to be the number one company in punctuality.

Like all airlines, this one has a limited staff, so the crew of one flight is the same as for another flight on a different route, meaning the plane can't depart until the previous flight has arrived. Additionally, crew rest protocols must be adhered to.

But that's not all; there are operators who must perform maintenance functions, refueling, cleaning, passenger boarding, luggage loading, etc., so delays in some of these actions could cause flight delays, preventing the company from meeting its self-imposed punctuality standards.

The board assigns a young telecommunications engineer, Emily, to develop a master plan that identifies areas where the company can improve its punctuality compared to the competition, making it a first choice among users.

This young engineer, recently graduated, spent her summers in Spain and had friends who had created a startup that was bought by Iberia. This startup solved the problem of labels that deteriorated or were tampered with by users, utilizing AI-based technology through computer vision (known as the "Vision Tech AI"), which can read any alphanumeric system no matter how deteriorated it is. Taking advantage of the fact that the airline was part of a holding company with a Spanish one, she decided to seek collaboration with this small Spanish firm.

The proposal Emily brought to the airline's Board of Directors earned her a substantial salary increase and more responsibilities within the company. The plan was so well received that it was implemented immediately, and the company became the world leader in punctuality, with its Spanish "sister" surprisingly in second place. The plan involved implementing AI technology at all levels.

A 17-point plan was created, which the operators in charge of preparing the planes had to follow. Using sensors in the work areas, information was received about the time operators needed to perform their tasks, allowing for accurate flight scheduling. The system detected if there was a possible risk of task time overruns and alerted a supervisor in advance.

Moreover, AI technology was implemented in other sectors, such as customer service, boarding system, check-in, luggage distribution, post-sale service, etc.


## To do:
1. Question
The operators had to fill out a short form about their activity each time they completed a task. A network of cameras was installed in the work environment. How can Artificial Intelligence analyze whether an operator who has completed their task but hasn't filled out the report is not treated as a problem overall?

2. Question
The "Vision Tech AI" system can read any alphanumeric label no matter the state it is in. But how can it achieve this? Could it read a label that is missing some characters?

3. Question
What role would Artificial Intelligence have in an assistant in a customer service center? Could it sell a ticket?

4. Question
How can Artificial Intelligence help in passenger boarding?

5. Question
One option of the plan was to include a humanoid robot in Heathrow Airport. How could this help with flight punctuality? Could users from other companies use the robot's services? Could the robot hold a conversation with the user to meet their requests?
